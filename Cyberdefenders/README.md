This website has awesome labs, HOWEVER not everything can be published, thus some CTFs can be encrypted into archives.

## Can I create and publish write-ups for labs and challenges?

> Yes, you can create and publish write-ups (both written and video) for labs and challenges, but this is restricted to content that has been labeled as "retired." This restriction is in place to maintain the credibility of current active content. By adhering to this guideline, you play a crucial role in upholding the overall credibility of the platform's educational resources.
